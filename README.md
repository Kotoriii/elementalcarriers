Elemental Carriers is a third person PC adventure video game created with Unity 3D 5.2. for a university project with third party assets that were mostly used with slight texture, animation and behavior modifications. It uses C# scripts imported from several assets which feature heavy modifications to suit the game's purposes.
The game consists of 3 stages that resemble today's cities like Munich and Zurich and a variety of enemies that attack with their elemental powers, while your chosen main character (male or female) wields a weapon among 4 choices and has 4 different abilities to overcome his or her enemies.

Short summary of the game (background provided by C.Jiménez):

It’s the year 2020. Switzerland’s Large Hadron Collider creates something similar to a black hole while searching for dark matter. A number of humanoids emerge from the hole and announce the existence of a parallel world inhabited by them, while declaring war to our species.
	Humanity fights off the first waves of enemies, but the creatures’ powers, which are called “Elementalites” and allow their carriers to control elements like air, ground, water and fire, start to defeat our conventional weapons. The world starts to use nuclear weapons in a desperate attempt to stop the invaders, with little success.
	Prominent scientist Solz Tracer is put in charge of an operation to put Elementalites’ fallen weapons to use by humans. These, however, consume and kill their earthling possessors, reason why the program is shut down and its crew, including Solz and his workers, disappear. Mankind is on the verge of extinction.
